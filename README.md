# HushBindingGen

CLI utility to generate boilerplate bindings for the Hush engine from C header files.

## Description

This project turns the C header file generated by hush-llvm (hush-export) into idiomatic bindings across multiple languages. It parses a focused subset of C—structs and functions—and crafts bindings for:
- C#
- Rust  
- Beef

**Note:** This tool intentionally skips A LOT of the C specification. It's not trying to be compliant with the entire C language standard, just the specific pieces that power the Hush engine's C++20 codebase.

## Usage

```bash
HushBindingGen [input-file] --lang=[rust, beef, csharp, all] # Defaults to all
```

Feed it the C header and provided the language interface is implemented, you'll get a folder with the bindings as output

## Supported Features

- Primitive types (int8_t, int16_t, int32_t, int64_t, uint8_t, uint16_t, uint32_t, uint64_t, float, double, bool, char)
- Struct declarations with proper alignment
- Function declarations and signatures
- Function pointers
- Arrays and nested structures

## Implementation

In the Beef programming language for performance and ease of development, intentionally going against the implementation of a lexer and tokenizer for simplicity
